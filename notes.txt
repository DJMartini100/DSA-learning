in free time that i got while at work
checked that
big:
O(1) = top card
O(log n) = presorted cards devide in half and half until get desired card
O(n)=find your card 1by1 worse case scenario 52
O(n^2) = pick top card and compare to all other cards 52x52
O(2^n) = i m looking for every combo the more cards the higher combo list. 
1 card 2 combos, 2 cards 4 combos, 3 cards 8 combos, 10 is 1024 combos

O(n!) = all possible orders
3 cards 6 possible orders
4 cards 24 possible orders
5 cards 120 possible orders
10 cards 36288000 orders


note: have to push it to main to see the changes later on.
